If it exits non-zero or any console error is reported, FIX THE ERRORS in the source, then
re-run, and repeat until the capture is clean. A capture with runtime errors is worthless —
the critics would be judging a broken frame.

fix the cause — either in tools/shot.mjs if the harness is positioning things wrongly, or in

const CRITIC_BASE = `You are a hostile senior art director reviewing screenshots from a Three.js kart racing game
that is trying to match the visual quality of a shipped Nintendo Mario Kart title.

The shots are in ${ROOT}/${OUT}/ — READ EVERY PNG IN THAT DIRECTORY with the Read tool. You are
judging the actual pixels, not the source code. You may read source afterwards to work out WHY
something looks wrong and to make your fix suggestions specific and actionable, but your
findings must originate from what you can see in the images.

Also read ${ROOT}/ART_DIRECTION.md — section 9 is the formal rubric.

## How to judge
Hold the frames to the standard of a shipped, retail, first-party console racing game. Not
"good for a web demo". Not "impressive for procedural". The comparison class is Mario Kart 8
Deluxe and Mario Kart World running on real hardware: images with authored lighting, dense
coherent worlds, immaculate material response and total visual confidence.

Be harsh. Generous scoring here produces a worse game. The specific failure mode to avoid is
finding three cosmetic nits and declaring victory while an obvious structural problem — a flat
lighting wash, an empty horizon, plastic-looking materials — sits in the middle of the frame.
Lead with the biggest problem in the image, not the easiest one to describe.

Scoring calibration, apply it strictly:
  0-40   reads as a programmer-art prototype
  40-60  a competent hobby project; obviously not commercial
  60-75  a good indie game; still clearly not first-party
  75-88  near-professional, but a trained eye spots the tells immediately
  88-95  genuinely shipped-AAA quality
  95+    best-in-class

Almost nothing deserves 88+ on an early round. If you are inclined to give 85, look harder —
you are probably missing something.

Every finding must name the specific technical fix and the owning subsystem, because your
output is dispatched directly to the engineer who owns that module. Vague findings ("lighting
could be better") are useless and will be discarded. Say what to change.

or dither cleanly? Does the fog match the sky at the horizon or is there a seam? Is there aerial
perspective separating fore/mid/background? Is anything blown out or crushed to pure black? Do
shadows actually land where the sun direction says they should? Is there bounce light, or do
shadowed areas look dead? Does the env map appear to be lighting the PBR materials at all?
Judge whether the frame's light tells a story or merely illuminates.`,

highlight)? Is the tarmac aggregate visible at close range? Do materials hold up at BOTH the
close-up shot and the wide shot? Count the visibly distinct surface responses in each frame —

into the distance? Is there foreground/midground/background layering, or does everything sit on
one plane? Is the scene dense enough to feel like a PLACE — a real coastal circuit with a
village, a harbour, crowds, foliage — or does it look like a road in a void with a few props
scattered on it? Are there dead zones of empty ground? Does the track's shape read clearly so
the player can anticipate the next corner? Is the scenery placed with intent or scattered

shadow map swimming, low-poly silhouettes on curved forms, LOD popping, texture stretching on
slopes, seams where meshes meet, particles slicing through the ground (no soft-particle depth
fade), banding in gradients, and blown-out additive effects stacking to white. These are the
details that separate "shipped" from "student project". Also assess the kart itself as a hero

tier-coloured? Is there tyre smoke, dust, skid marks, exhaust flame? Do effects sit in the
scene's lighting or glow flatly on top of it? Is the camera framing dynamic — does the kart
slide across the frame in the drift shot, does the banked curve tilt the horizon? Is the scene
readable as gameplay: can you tell where the track goes, where your rivals are, what state
you're in? Judge the sheer ENERGY of the frames against a Mario Kart screenshot, which is always

minimap the true track shape and does it read instantly? Is the layout balanced, with proper
margins, or does it crowd the edges? Do the elements feel like one designed system or a

## What to do
1. LOOK AT THE EVIDENCE FIRST. Read the relevant PNGs in ${ROOT}/${OUT}/ yourself so you are
   fixing what is actually in the image, not what the description sounds like. If you believe a
   finding is wrong — you looked and the problem is not there, or the suggested fix would make
   it worse — do not implement it. Say so in your report with your reasoning. You are the
   expert on your subsystem; the critics are judging pixels and may misattribute a cause.
2. Fix every finding you agree with, blockers first. Go beyond the literal suggestion where the
   real fix is deeper — the critics describe symptoms, and treating a symptom while the cause
   remains means it comes back next round.
3. Read ${ROOT}/ART_DIRECTION.md and stay inside it. Do not drift the art direction to dodge a
   note.
4. Stay in your own files. Never edit src/types.ts. If a fix genuinely requires another
   subsystem to change, do not reach into their file — describe it in your report and it will
   be routed next round.
5. Verify your work compiles:  cd ${ROOT} && npx tsc --noEmit 2>&1 | grep -E '(${OWNER_FILES[owner].split(', ').join('|')})'
   Do NOT run the dev server or tools/shot.mjs — other agents are running in parallel and the
   port is shared.
6. Do not regress performance to win a beauty note. The budget in section 8 still holds.

Report: what you changed and why, what you rejected and why, and anything you need from
another subsystem.`,
      { label: `fix:${owner}`, phase: 'Fix' }

  })

phase('Verify')

// The draw-call budget is the one quality axis no art critic will ever defend,
// so it gets its own dedicated pass rather than competing for a fix slot.
const perf = await agent(
  `cd ${ROOT}. You are the PERFORMANCE engineer for this Three.js kart racer.

ART_DIRECTION.md section 8 budgets **250 draw calls in a typical frame** at Quality.High/1080p.
The last measurement was **315 median, 590 peak** — over budget, and ten specialists have just
added more density on top of that.

1. Measure properly. Instrument with renderer.info (set autoReset = false and reset manually
   around the scene pass — note that with autoReset on, the composer's final fullscreen quad
   masks everything and reads as 1 draw call, which is why this was missed). Get a real
   per-frame draw call count, triangle count and texture/program count across several vantage
   points. You can drive the game headlessly with:
     node tools/shot.mjs --only hero,wide,pack --settle 3 --w 1280 --h 720 --out shots/perf
2. Find where the calls actually go. Group them by subsystem — scenery props, foliage, crowd,
   track segments, karts, particles, decals, UI. Report the real distribution before changing
   anything; optimising the wrong thing is worse than not optimising.
3. Cut it to budget. The tools, in order of preference: merge static geometry that never moves
   independently, convert repeated meshes to InstancedMesh, share materials so batches are not
   broken by trivial uniform differences, add LOD and distance culling, and turn off shadow
   casting on objects whose shadow nobody can see. Do NOT delete content to hit the number —
   the density is the point. Instance it instead.
4. Re-measure and report the before/after honestly, including anything you could not fix.

You may edit any rendering or world file, but do not change the art direction, do not remove
scenery, and do not touch src/types.ts. Verify with npx tsc --noEmit when done.

Report the real numbers. If you cannot reach 250 without cutting content, say so plainly and
report where you landed and what the remaining cost is.`,

2. node tools/shot.mjs --out shots/r${ROUND}-verify --settle 3 --w 1920 --h 1080
   Iterate until it exits clean with zero console errors.
3. Read the new PNGs and compare them against the previous round in ${ROOT}/${OUT}/.
   State plainly, per frame, whether it improved, stayed the same, or REGRESSED. Regressions
   matter more than improvements — a fix that broke something else must be caught here.
