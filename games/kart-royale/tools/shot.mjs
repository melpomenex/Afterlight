 * drawn into — grain, vignette and speed lines composited over black. It is not
 * a rendering bug (the same tear shows up on the pre-round tree, and the frame
 * is fine again the moment you re-shoot it), but the harness used to write it to
 * disk regardless and exit clean, which is the worst possible outcome: the
 * report says ten shots and one of them is a black rectangle.

 * so `TORN_DARK_FRAC` sits in the middle of the gap.
 *
 * A seam-detecting version of this was tried first — vertical bands, looking for
 * a step between neighbours — and caught two tears in five. The dark side of the
 * seam is not actually black (grain, vignette and speed lines lift it to ~20),
 * and when the tear takes most of the frame there is no bright band left to step
 * against. The plain area test caught all of them and false-positived on none of
 * the twenty known-good frames, so the seam test is gone rather than kept as a

      // up by deliberately over-steering into the corner for half a second.

      // the straights, where a drift's built-in yaw bias (0.55 of lock toward
      // driftDir, with no corner to spend it on) simply drives the kart in a
      // circle. That is the frame it produced: a kart scribing loops on the
      // approach road, sideways in the corner of shot, tier stuck at 1.
      //
      // What the AI cannot do is hold one long enough. Tier 2 needs 2.0 s of
      // charge and the AI bails at ~1.3 s — not because the corner ends (the
      // two long ones here run 239 m and 191 m, ten seconds of road) but
      // because it runs wide and its own `wide` guard pulls the plug. It runs
      // wide because a slide halves its steering authority and offsets it by
      // 0.55 toward driftDir, and its PD gains are not tuned for that. So every
      // unaided slide on this circuit tops out at tier 1.

      // corner for the length of the slide. Bias its steer inward while the
      // charge builds and the kart holds the angle through the corner it is
