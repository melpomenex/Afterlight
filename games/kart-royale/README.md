# Kart Royale

A Mario Kart-style racer in the browser. **No art assets.** No Blender, no Unity,
no textures, no models, no fonts, no audio files — every mesh, texture, sound and
note is generated in code at load time.

*Every pixel above is generated at runtime. The kerb stripes, the crowd, the tyre
tread, the sparks, the sky — there is not a single image file in this repository.*

Built by Claude Opus 5 from a single prompt, then improved over nine orchestrated
multi-agent rounds.

The prompting technique is the **[Gauntlet Loop](https://somethingbig.ai/gauntlet-loop)**,
named and developed by [Matt Shumer](https://x.com/mattshumer_): give a lead agent a goal and a
concrete example of what great looks like, let it decompose the work into pieces that can be
improved independently, and give each piece a *separate* critic that compares the output against
the bar and sends it back until it clears. The separation of builder and critic is the whole
idea — a builder grading its own homework is not a measurement.

The interesting wrinkle in this project was what happened when the bar could not be used as
stated. See below.

## The prompt

Verbatim, typo and all:

> I want you to build a **kat racing game** at the level of the most recent Mario
> Kart games. It should be utterly perfect, visually beautiful, with every single
> thing done at AAA quality—from textures to physics to anything you could think
> of.
>
> Fan out sub-agents and have sub-agents tackle each one individually so that the
> game is utterly perfect. You should `/loop` on each item and have a separate
> sub-agent check it visually to ensure it looks triple A. That separate sub-agent
> should be a really harsh critic, and if it doesn't look triple A, it should keep
> going.
>
> Don't stop until each sub-agent is utterly wowed with the quality when compared
> with the actual Mario Kart game. It should literally compare them side by side
> blind and say which one looks better. Do this in ThreeJS. `/loop` until it's
> utterly perfect. Fan out sub-agents and ultracode.

### The bar problem

A Gauntlet Loop needs a concrete, inspectable bar. This prompt named one — *compare it side by
side, blind, against the actual Mario Kart* — and that bar could not be used: it would have meant
scraping copyrighted frames, and a model declaring itself the winner of its own comparison is not
a measurement.

So the bar was rewritten as an explicit rubric with hard calibration bands, in
`ART_DIRECTION.md` section 9:

> ```
> 0-40   reads as a programmer-art prototype
> 40-60  a competent hobby project; obviously not commercial
> 60-75  a good indie game; still clearly not first-party
> 75-88  near-professional, but a trained eye spots the tells immediately
> 88-95  genuinely shipped-AAA quality
> ```
> *"Almost nothing deserves 88+ on an early round. If you are inclined to give 85, look harder —
> you are probably missing something."*

That substitution is the single change that made the loop work. A critic told to compare against
a reference it cannot see produces vibes; a critic given calibrated bands and told that generous
scoring produces a worse game produces specific, routable findings — which subsystem, which
frame, which fix.

The second thing that mattered: **the critics judge rendered screenshots from a real headless
build, not source code.** That is what makes them an oracle rather than a second opinion. It is
also where the loop's blind spot lives — see the last item under *Things that went wrong*.

## Running it

```bash
npm install
npm run dev      # http://localhost:5173
npm run build    # tsc --noEmit && vite build
```

Useful URL flags:

| flag | what it does |
|---|---|
| `?quality=low\|medium\|high\|ultra` | override the auto-detected tier |
| `?debug=gl` | print a GPU/extension/shader-error report; `__gl()` in the console |
| `?debug=frames` | sample the drawing buffer for partial-black presents |

In the console: `__feel.punchy()` retunes the sense of speed live, `__gl()` dumps
a diagnostic report, `R` records gameplay to a `.webm`.

## What's in here

| | |
|---|---|
| **~60,500 lines** | across 49 source files |
| **4 runtime deps** | `three`, `postprocessing`, `n8ao`, `simplex-noise` |
| **0 art assets** | textures, meshes, liveries, audio — all procedural |
| **13 test harnesses** | in `tools/`, several of which are the interesting part |

Notable pieces: a raycast-suspension kart with a slip-angle tyre model and
mini-turbo drifting (`src/kart/`), a spline circuit with banking and surface
zoning (`src/world/`), a procedural material library with a noise toolkit
(`src/render/`), a racing-line AI (`src/game/AI.ts`), and a Web Audio synthesis
stack with a procedurally generated reverb impulse (`src/audio/`).

`ART_DIRECTION.md` is the written art bible every agent worked against — course
layout, exact sun angle, palette hexes, material standards. It is the reason
eleven agents working in parallel produced something coherent.

## The harness is the actual artifact

The game is a demo. The reusable thing is `tools/` — the rigs that made it
possible to improve a game nobody could sit and play for a hundred hours:

| tool | what it measures |
|---|---|
| `shot.mjs` | drives the game to 10 scripted vantage points and captures them |
| `camera-probe.mjs` | camera lag, swing (the nausea metric), framing, settle time |
| `drift-bench.mjs` | **is a drifting lap actually faster than a clean one?** |
| `autoplay.mjs` | plays full races; asserts on classification, items, deadlocks, NaN |
| `mobile-soak.mjs` | texture memory, heap growth, WebGL context loss on an emulated phone |
| `hitch-check.mjs` | correlates frame spikes with shader compilation |
| `tear-hunt.mjs` | hunts partial-black frames and records what every layer thought its size was |
| `context-loss-test.mjs` | takes the GL context away and proves the game comes back |

The loop was: render → a panel of six hostile art directors score the **pixels**
against an explicit rubric → route each finding to the subsystem that owns it →
fix in parallel → verify, hunting regressions specifically.

## Honest numbers

Last full score against a shipped-Mario-Kart bar, from a panel calibrated so that
60–75 means *"a good indie game; still clearly not first-party"*:

**62 / 100.** It does not have better graphics than Mario Kart World.

The drift-to-boost loop scores **74/100** on the only question that matters for a
kart racer — *would a player rerun this track to nail a cleaner lap?* Drifting is
measurably faster (2.03 s/lap against a 0.44 % noise floor), but 56 % of that
advantage comes from a single corner, and 83 % of drift attempts never bank a
mini-turbo tier. The ladder that should make it a skill is still mostly
decoration. That's the top of the backlog.

## Things that went wrong, which are the useful part

- **The post-processing chain was silently dead for four rounds.** `PostFX.build`
  set a property that exists on `N8AOPass` but not `N8AOPostPass`; it threw, the
  pipeline caught the failure and disabled itself. Every High/Ultra frame
  rendered with no AO, no bloom, no colour grade and no antialiasing while
  critics wrote "there is no antialiasing in the frame at all" — a crash report
  nobody decoded as one.
- **A correct-sounding cleanup reintroduced a rendering bug.** A guard reading
  `ssao ? 0 : msaa` was removed because the comment justifying it was wrong. The
  comment *was* wrong; the guard was right. MSAA on the buffer the AO pass samples
  as a texture meant the resolve didn't reliably land — 7.6 % of frames came back
  part-black. Comments that explain *why* are load-bearing.
- **Two instruments confidently lied.** A frame watchdog reported 100 % black on
  frames that presented perfectly, because `preserveDrawingBuffer` was false and
  it was reading a discarded buffer. A camera probe reported nonsense because
  `Vector3.project` is a point transform and it was handed a camera-relative
  vector. Validate the instrument against ground truth before trusting a reading.
- **`envMapIntensity` crushed to 0.40 globally** nullified every metal reflection
  and clearcoat lobe in the game — one constant defeating thousands of lines of
  material work.
- **The screenshot critics found none of the gameplay bugs.** Inverted steering,
  missing mobile controls, black frames, a pause menu that suspended the race
  permanently, a phone crash at ten seconds — every one came from a human playing.
  Automated visual critique is structurally blind to everything a still frame
  cannot show.
